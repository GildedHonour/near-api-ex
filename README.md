`mix.exs`:

``` elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:near_api, "~> 0.1.3"}
  ]
end
```

## Development

It is recommended to run local sandbox node for faster development and run automated tests.
To install nearcore sandbox locally do the following from the project root:

```shell
cd bin && ./install_sandbox.sh
```

The sandbox will be installed into git-ignored directory `test/sandbox`. 
To run sandbox node, run from the project root directory:

```shell
cd bin && ./run_sandbox.sh
```
